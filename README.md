Below commands are available for use -

  > * **javadoc-tools.generateJavadoc.targetFolder** - Sets the target folder where the Javadoc will be generated. Default path will be ${WorkspaceRoot}\\javadoc
  > * **javadoc-tools.generateJavadoc.runMode** - Set value to run in corresponding mode. Default value is \"-public\". Possible values are ["-package","-private","-protected","-public"]
